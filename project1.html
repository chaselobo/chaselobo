        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a math aimed to help students practice their adding, subtracting, and multiplication skills. It has themes of sustainable human consumption and cleaning the planet by having the points refer to picking up garbage. The scoreboard will show you player names, ID's, amounts of garbage picked up, and amount of games played which is referred to as hours of cleaning on the scoreboard. To play you must first add your player by inputting a name and an ID number (can be any amount of digits) then you need to select your player. Once your player is selected, you can press 3 to play the game. When you go to the game menu you will be given the choice to play easy mode or hard mode.</p>
        <p>Easy mode: Gives you 10 basic multiplication as well as addition and subtraction problems using a random number generator that gives you numbers 1 to 10. In easy mode you will be rewarded 1 point for a question correctly answered and it will subtract 1 point for a question answered incorrectly. You will also be timed and penalized for taking too long on the game. You will lose 1 point if you take over 40 second, 2 points if its over 50 seconds, and 3 points if its over 60 seconds.</p>
        <p>Hard mode: Gives you 10 more difficult multiplication problems and you will be asked 3 digit addition and subtraction problems. In hard mode you will be rewarded 2 points for a problem answered correctly and 1 point for a problem answered incorrectly. There is still a time penalty but you are given double the amount of time as easy mode. You get 80 seconds until your first point is taken away, 100 until 2 points are subtracted, and 120 until 3 points are subtracted.</p>
